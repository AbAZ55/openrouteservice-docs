API Keys
========

Before you can use the APIs of the `OpenRouteService <http://www.openrouteservice.org>`__ you need an :term:`API-Key`. They are a 32-character identifier, made of letters and numbers, which relates the request to the user. In case of miss- or overuse of the APIs (see :ref:`tos-ref`) it is a lot easier for us to maintain order. To get your personal API-Key you have to request it directly from us.

How to use an API key
---------------------

To use your API key simply add it as a parameter in your request URL with: ::

	&api_key=`your-api-key`

:ref:`Here <example-ref>` you can see an example with the API key at the end of the request.

Here is an |**This**|.

.. |**This**| replace:: :ref:`Here <example-ref>`
