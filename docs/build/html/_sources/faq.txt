Frequently Asked Questions
=============================


**Why do the acent and decent values differ with the roundtrip feature on the way back ?**

	This comes from the simple fact that altitude recordings made by a GPS are extremely inaccurate. To calculate the altitude, the GPS requires good reception of at least three satellites. If reception differs during two visits of a location, the derived ascent and descent values will also differ.

**Why is there no content here?**

	We are building this site up right now, so please have patience.
